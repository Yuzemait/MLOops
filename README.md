# MLOps
This project demonstrates a basic MLOps pipeline, including:
- Model training and artifact saving.
- API with prediction and health check endpoints.
- Monitoring using hypothesis tests (Chi-squared and Kolmogorov-Smirnoff).
- Data collection of new predictions.

## How to Run
1. Train the model by running the training script.
2. Start the API to get predictions.
3. Use the Python script to send requests to the API.
